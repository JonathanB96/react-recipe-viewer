# Recipe Viewer

## Overview

All your quick and favorite recipes in on place. You may finally ditch the old recipe book since you can find
what you need here plus you can quickly search, find and even store your newest recipes.

##Usage
Each 'recipe card' has a show/hide button that displays all the necessary steps you need to take for your 
recipe. A search bar is provided to help you find a particular dish by name as well as a way to add a new recipe 
on your list by navigating to the "Add recipe" page.
